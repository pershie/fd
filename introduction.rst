Introduction.
Background.
The metadata changelog and monitoring app is intended to provide certain information on DHIS2 activities to only permitted users by tracking the edits performed on the metadata so as to know the type of changes made to avoid adverse effects and hold the users accountable. This helps by creating a sense of responsibility and for members of the MOH to make informed decisons based on the data curated and collected.
